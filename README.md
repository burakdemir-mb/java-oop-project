This repository serves as a collection of Java projects that I have developed, starting from the basics and progressing towards more advanced topics, including enterprise architecture simulations.

All projects in this repository follow object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

You can explore the enterprise architecture coding project in the oopWithNLayeredApp directory. It demonstrates how object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and layered architectures integrate to create a structured application.
